# PyLadiesCon Web

## Generation

Go to the `generate_site/` directory,
install the requirements from `requirements.txt`,
and that wil generate the `index.html` and `about.html`
files for the web.

## Adding Opengraph Meta tag

When adding a new page to the site, please be sure to update the OpenGraph
meta tag. These tags are useful when sharing the links on social media,
it generates a nice preview of the site.

To add this info, refer to the `og_meta` tags defined for the current templates (about, index) in `generate.py`.

To preview  the changes, you can use browser extension, for example Chrome
OGraph Previewer.
