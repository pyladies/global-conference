# The conference server

This year we have decided to try a new platform that has been widely used in other online
conferences, and has shown a good level of customization, interactions, and reach. We are talking
about [Discord](https://discord.com).

We are providing our server to host all the interactions of the people attending the second year of
PyLadiesCon, so we really **encourage you to join** and discover our talks, activities, open spaces,
sprints, tutorials, resources, and more!

For Discord users, joining our server is just joining a new server! but if **you are new to
Discord**, don't worry, we got you cover. As a first step, you need to [create an
account](https://discord.com/register). You an also do this while joining the server for the first
time.

  </a>
  <p style="font-size: 0.8rem;">
  You need a <a href="https://pretix.eu/pyladiescon/2024">ticket for the conference</a> in order to have access.

## Registration step

Once you enter the server, you will not see many channels, because you need to register
with your **conference ticket**.

Check the `#registration` channel, and you will see the following message:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<img src="/img/discord_screenshots/register.png" class="img-fluid" />
{{< /rawhtml >}}

all the instructions can be found there, and they consist on:

* Getting your conference ticket at hand. The email should have the subject `[PyLdiesCon 2024] Your
  order: XXXXX` where the `X` are different letters. On that email you find a URL to get the details
  of your ticket. From your ticket you need the **exact** way you wrote your name, and the `X`s code.

* Click on the **Register here 👈** button, and you will get the following dialog:

  {{< rawhtml >}}
  <img src="/img/discord_screenshots/register_enterinfo.png" class="img-fluid" />
  {{< /rawhtml >}}

  and enter the information you gathered from your ticket.

If everything worked well, you will see many more channels 🎉...but **if it didn't work** please use
the forum called  `💬registration-help` (in the following image) and write down your problem, so we
can help you out.

## Inside the server

You are finally in the server, and there will be many channels, categories, and things to do.
If you are new to discord, this might look overwhelming at the beginning, but you will get the
idea very fast.

We recommend you to visit the `📖rules` and `📋code-of-conduct` channels to be aware of the
standards we expect from people participating in the conference.

There will be some channels where you don't have permissions to send messages, because they are
probably for the organizers to announce things during the event.

Discord, like other chat platforms, has many channels for you to visit and write messages,
but in addition you can create 'threads' on specific messages (like Slack).

### Joining talks, keynotes and panels

The Talks, Keynotes, and Panels will be transmitted via YouTube, so you will have two options:

* Watch them directly on YouTube, or
* Watch them within Discord.

The interaction will be **only on Discord** so we encourage you to stay around and join the
**media channels** in order to watch the videos, because the chat will be disable on YouTube.

As you might have seen in our schedule, we have a **Main Room** and one for **Activities and Open
Spaces**, which will be equivalent to the `main-room` and `activities-room`.

In the following image you can also find the channels `main-room-media` and `activities-media`
which are **Audio channels**. You can distinguish them by the 🔈 icon on the left side.

{{< rawhtml >}}
<img src="/img/discord_screenshots/main_channels.png" class="img-fluid" />
{{< /rawhtml >}}

When you click this channel, **you will enter automatically** (a sound will get your attention) and
once inside, you can enable/disable your microphone and video.

Even though this is an audio channel, it can also be used to shared videos, so a volunteer will
start an Activity within that channel with the YouTube streaming that you will be able to join,
**and this will be the mechanism to watch the talks**.

### The sprints and activities

As long as there is no special announcement, all the sprints and activities will be hosted within
discord on the Audio channels we described before. Instead of the normal activity on YouTube that
you can join, people will share their webcams, and screens in order to provide the introduction
to the topic (sprints) and to give a short presentation (activities).

### Forums

You will see a few channels that have the icon 💬 on the left side, and those are special channels
where you can write down posts, so the discussion can be structured by topics instead of a open
chat.

There are a few forums for discussing news (`news-discussion`), you can use them in case you need
help with something (`rooms-help`), share resources (`resources`), finding job offerings
(`job-board`), etc.

If you want to **create a new post** in those forums, you can use the blue button you can see on the
following image, to do so.

<img src="/img/discord_screenshots/forums.png" class="img-fluid" />
{{< /rawhtml >}}

### Contacting organizers and volunteers

While writing messages you can type `@` to mention certain roles, and we encourage you to mention
`@Organizer`, `@Volunteer` or `@Code of Conduct` in case you believe a situation require their
attention.

(In case you want to mention a channel, you can use the `#` symbol when writing a message.)

### Changing your nickname

When you enter the server and register successfully, your nickname will be changed to the one
you have written in your Ticket. We encourage you to use your real name so other people can
recognize you. In case you want to only use your **firstname** and drop your family name, you can do
that by `right-clicking` on your nickname, and select **Edit Server Profile**. This will change the
information **only on this server** so you don't need to be concerned by your identities in other
servers you have joined.

{{< rawhtml >}}
<img src="/img/discord_screenshots/change_profile.png" class="img-fluid" />
{{< /rawhtml >}}

Once editing your name, you can optionally fill your **Pronouns** so people know how to address you.

{{< rawhtml >}}
<img src="/img/discord_screenshots/change_profile_details.png" class="img-fluid" />
{{< /rawhtml >}}


## Something is not clear?

In case you have more questions, feel free to write down your question in the `💬help` forum,
so people can guide you.

Enjoy the conference!
