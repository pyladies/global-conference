Attention all PyLadies community members! We’re excited to share that we are in the early stages of planning a

and empowerment within the Python community. 🎉

Save the date! The conference will take place on December 6th-8th, where we’ll gather together
for a weekend filled with insightful talks, engaging panels, and collaborative networking opportunities.
