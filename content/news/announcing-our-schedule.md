## Help make this edition of the global PyLadies conference a reality

The conference again will be fully online, and run entirely by volunteers. We are intentionally making it free,
online, inclusive, and accessible, so that as many of our members as possible can benefit from it in order to
further advance their careers. Your sponsorship of the Global PyLadies Conference will make it possible to offer
that experience to women everywhere. And by being a sponsor you and your company will gain exposure to PyLadies and
Pythonistas around the world as partners in our mission to include more women in Python and open source.

**If you’re interested in supporting our work,** you can check out the options in our sponsor prospectus now available
at [https://conference.pyladies.com/sponsors](https://conference.pyladies.com/sponsors), or you can get in touch with our sponsorship team at sponsors@pyladies.com.

*PyLadies is a direct project of the Python Software Foundation (“the PSF”). In addition to tax deductibility as
a marketing expense for our sponsors, any applicable benefits of the PSF’s 501©3 designation from the IRS also may apply.
Determination letter from the IRS designating the PSF as a charitable organization available from the PSF website.*
