We're excited to welcome you at PyLadiesCon 2024 and kick-off all of our keynotes, talks, panels, and workshops.

Here are a few important details on how to join and participate.

### Our conference schedule

Check the full [conference schedule](https://conference.pyladies.com/schedule) to find out when the talks, keynotes, panels, and workshops will be happening

### How to watch the talks

Our sessions are streamed on YouTube on [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOItnwPQ-eHxWh6Af6xRuKprSk_OBU0cL). 

Each of our pre-recorded videos and talks have been transcribed by our volunteers, and you can access the transcription by clicking the "CC" button on the video, or by clicking the "Show Transcript" button on each video's description.

Although most of our talks are in English, we do have several presentations in other languages, like in Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese. For these talks, transcript in their original language are available, and additionally our volunteers have translated them into English. You can access the English transcript translation by clicking the "Settings" (Gear) icon on YouTube > CC/Subtitles > English. 

For sessions that are conducted live (like the keynotes, and panel discussions), the automatic captioning is available from YouTube as well.

### Join us on Discord

This is our main communication channel where you will be able to engage with other attendees.
 Please read [this page](https://conference.pyladies.com/discord/) for details on how to join.

Use the Discord ``#main-room`` channel to chat and discuss the talks with other audiences. Many of our speakers will be around to answer questions about their talk asynchronously.

### Participating in Workshops

Our interactive workshops are hosted on Discord on the ``#activities`` and ``#activities-media`` channels. Simply show up and join the channel to participate! Note that workshops are not recorded.

### Ask Python Core Devs

We are honored to have a few Python core developers participating in our conference and they be happy to answer any questions you have, from their career path, open source contribution experience, to their favorite ice cream flavor. Join them in the ``#ask-core-devs`` channel.

### Mentored Sprint

Mentored Sprint is a beginner-friendly sprint that encourages new contributors to open source. During the sprints, project leaders will be able to help you pick an issue, set up your development environment, and show you the contribution workflow. You may also be encouraged to pair up with someone to contribute together.

The sprint orientation starts on Dec 6th at 20:40 UTC and the sprint itself will continue throughout the conference. Check the [Sprints](https://conference.pyladies.com/about/sprints/) page for more details.

### Donate to PyLadiesCon

There is still time to [donate](https://pretix.eu/pyladiescon/2024/) to PyLadiesCon. Our event is free, however you can further support our mission by donating. You can donate by selecting the "General Donation (not an entry ticket)" option. We have created a special Discord role for those who have donated through our registration process, where you get a special 💰 (moneybag) emoji next to your name on Discord. If you have donated and don't see this emoji on Discord, please let us know and we'll get that sorted out.
