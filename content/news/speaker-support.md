## Technical support

Since all of the speakers at PyLadiesCon 2024 are required to record their talk, we understand some of you may worry that your setup at home is not good enough for the recording or worry that you don't know how to record. We got your back! Check out our [speaker's guide here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ivarWnqisA2kVIJL3Sn4XKo9obt3sADL7MTx1bPchvI/edit?usp=sharing). If you still need some help in knowing what to do, do not hesitate to [get in touch with us](mailto:pyladiescon@pyladies.com). If you think you need support in getting recording equipment, we have recording equipment grants available. Please also [contact us](mailto:pyladiescon@pyladies.com) for more information.
