Dear PyLadies organizers, members, and supporters

We need your help in spreading the news of PyLadiesCon 2024. You, as one of our
organizers, members, and supporters, can help reach out to individuals who
could be a great speaker for the conference and who might have yet to hear of
the conference. Your connection and introduction will help make our conference
great.

We encourage you to invite potential speakers to submit a talk to PyLadies
Conference, this could be:

- Someone who have given talks at your event or an event that you attended (i.e
  another conference)
- Someone who showed interest in giving a talk
- Someone who has not given a talk but you know they’ve done interesting
  work/project that is worth sharing

You can help us in a variety of ways

1. Reach out to individuals by sending them an email or private message. Use
   your own wordings, or feel free to use one of the following by replacing
