To make clear what is expected, all members of the organizing committee,
attendees, speakers, organizers, sponsors, and volunteers at any PyLadiesCon
event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct as set forth by
the Python Software Foundation. Organizers will enforce this code throughout
the event.

The Python community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse 
set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences 
that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you're 
working with members of the community, this Code of Conduct will help steer your 
interactions and keep Python a positive, successful, and growing community.

  it’s on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise.
* **Focusing on what is best for the community.** We’re respectful of the
  processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
* **Acknowledging time and effort.** We’re respectful of the volunteer efforts
  that permeate the Python community. We're toughtful when addressing the
  efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed
  simply for the good of the community.
* **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.** We’re receptive
  to constructive comments and criticism,
  eriences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our
  efforts.
* **Showing empathy towards other community members.** We’re attentive in our
  communications, whether in person or online,
  and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
* **Being considerate.** Members of the community are considerate of their
  peers – other Python users.
* **Being respectful.** We’re respectful of others, their positions, their
  skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we are
  courteous in raising our issues.
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We’re accepting of all who wish
  to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can
  participate and everyone can make a difference.
