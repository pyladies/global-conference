# PyLadiesCon Web

## Generation

This process is automated with Github Pages.  The current mechanism relies on
executing the `generate.py` script inside `generate_site/` directory.

If you wan to locally check the generated site, you can manually go to the
`generate_site/` directory, install the requirements from `requirements.txt`,
and that wil generate the `index.html` and `about.html` files for the web.
