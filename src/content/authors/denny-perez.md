Denny Perez, a Software Quality Analyst at Nventive; currently based in Canada.
I graduated with a degree in Accounting from the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo and currently
have over 10 years of professional experience in finance.

In 2015, my life took a transformative turn when I immigrated to Canada.
Inspired by the potential of technology, I decided to pursue a second career in
Software Support and Management, which opened the door to a new path in the
technology field. During this process, I discovered my passion for the Python
programming language and the positive impact of technology communities.

Since then, I've been involved in various technology communities, both in Latin
America and globally. I've held key roles in project management, marketing,
event planning, and community engagement, always with a strong commitment to
diversity, equity, and inclusion.

In 2022, I was nominated as a PSF Fellow Member, a recognition given to
individuals who actively contribute to the Python programming language
ecosystem. In 2023, I was elected as a Director of the Python Software
Foundation, a role I continue to hold and that allows me to promote
collaboration and growth in the global Python community.

In addition to my professional life, I am a mother to three wonderful children
who are my constant source of inspiration to continue driving a more inclusive
and collaborative future, both in technology and in everyday life.
