Naomi Ceder earned a Ph.D in Classics several decades ago, but switched from
ancient human languages to computer languages sometime in the last century.
Since 2001, she has been learning, teaching, writing about, and using Python.

An elected fellow of the Python Software Foundation, Naomi is past chair of its
board of directors. She also speaks internationally about the Python community,
and on inclusion and diversity in technology in general.

Now mostly retired, she enjoys leaning classical and jazz guitar and reading
detective novels in Spanish and Portuguese.
