I’m an Open Source and Developer Advocate. As a Compulsive Community Organiser, my main focus is to empower individuals to learn by contributing to Open Source.

I’m active in the Python community as an event organiser and as a mentor for the Humble data workshops.

For my contributions to the Python and community, I’ve received the
PSF Community Service Award in 2024 and the EuroPython Fellowship title.
