I’m an open source maintainer and contributor. As a Python core developer, my
main focus is to improve the core workflow and documentation. I’m active in the
Python community as an advisor and administrator for the Global PyLadies,
co-founder of PyCascades. I’m chairing the PyCon US conference for the years
2023-2024. For my contributions to the Python and community, I’ve received the
PSF Community Service Award in 2018 and Google Open Source Peer Bonus Award in
2017 and 2020.
