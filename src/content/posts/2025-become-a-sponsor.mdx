We‚Äôre excited to invite you to be part of the **third edition of the Global PyLadies Conference** ‚Äî a unique, fully virtual gathering that brings together women Pythonistas from all around the world. As we prepare for the 2025 edition, we‚Äôre looking for sponsors who share our vision for a more inclusive, diverse, and accessible tech ecosystem.

## **Why Sponsor PyLadiesCon?**

**PyLadiesCon is not just another tech conference.** It‚Äôs a global initiative to amplify the voices of women in the Python ecosystem. Organized entirely by volunteers and offered **100% free to attendees**, this conference breaks down barriers by being **multilingual, multi-time zone, and globally inclusive**.

Your sponsorship ensures we can continue offering this space where women can learn, grow, and lead in open source.

But it doesn‚Äôt stop there.

## **Where Your Sponsorship Goes**

Every dollar raised through PyLadiesCon helps power broader diversity and inclusion efforts across the Python community:

- üíú **Travel Grants for Global PyLadies**  
   We help women attend PyCon US and other major conferences by providing travel grants that open doors to life-changing opportunities.

- üêç **Support for Local PyLadies Chapters**  
   With over 250 chapters worldwide, we equip our leaders with resources, mentorship, and training to build stronger, more connected communities.

Your support helps build a global, sustainable pipeline for women entering and growing in tech.

## **What‚Äôs New in 2025: Benefit Packages Redesigned**

This year, we‚Äôve **revamped our sponsorship benefit packages** to provide **even more value and visibility** for our supporters. Whether you're a small startup or a global company, we‚Äôve crafted packages that maximize the impact of your sponsorship in meaningful ways:

_‚ÄúIf I'm going to shill something for the next generation, there are people like Mariatta and others who are really working hard on PyLadiesCon.
