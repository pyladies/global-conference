PyLadiesCon team had a great time at PyCon US 2025 in Pittsburgh, PA.

During the conference, our team members were busy connecting and networking with the
Python community members, sharing news about our conference, and encouraging people
to attend, join, and support PyLadiesCon.

## Team bonding time

PyLadiesCon is organized by Python and PyLadies community members from all over the world. Our team interactions has
been mostly virtual through Discord messages and weekly online meetings. PyCon US is one of the rare event once a year
where most of our team members get to meet in person. We took this opportunity to meet in person, and strengthen our
friendship, camaraderie, and sense of community.

We had a wonderful time sharing stories, having dinner together, while also discussing how to continue serving the
community and make a successful PyLadiesCon in 2025. Thank you to Abigail Dogbe for coordinating
and organizing our team dinner.

## Recruiting our new team members

Running a global conference like PyLadiesCon is no simple task. It requires a lot of effort, time, and dedication from
our team members. We wanted to take this opportunity to recruit new core team members who are also passionate
about the community, and are willing and committed to help us organize the conference.

During this conference, we started talking to potential new team members, sharing our vision and mission,
our current challenges, and how they can help us.

We are excited to share that during PyCon US, we onboarded La√≠s Carvalho as our new team member! We will be introducing
her to the community in more official manner soon, but we are thrilled that she has started joining and helping
us.

Welcome to the team, La√≠s! üéâ

## Announcing our new Open Source project: PyLadiesCon Portal

We are excited to announce that we have started a new open source project called [PyLadiesCon Portal](https://portal.pyladies.com)
Built with Python and Django, the portal is designed to reduce the administrative burden and streamline the process of
organizing our conference. We believe
that by building this portal, not only we will be able to manage our conference more efficiently, but we will also be
providing open source contribution opportunities from our community members, and therefore furthering the [PyLadies](https://pyladies.com)
mission of helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community.

Mariatta gave a lightning talk about this project during the [Community Organizers Summit](https://us.pycon.org/2025/events/community-organizers-summit/).

## Sprinting at PyCon US

We also had a successful sprint at PyCon US lead by [Mariatta](https://github.com/mariatta), where we worked on the
PyLadiesCon Portal project. During the sprint, 16 new pull requests were created, and 8 of
them were merged. Some highlights include: starting the Brazilian Portuguese translation,
various documentation updates, email template update, and new user dashboard page.

Thank you to all of our sprint contributors, who not only contributed to the code, but also mentored
others during the sprint.

## Spreading News about PyLadiesCon

Throughout the conference, we had the opportunity to meet many Python and PyLadies community members
to share the news about PyLadiesCon. We shared stickers and set up our roll-up banner
at the PyLadies Booth. Our core team members were also wearing the newly designed PyLadiesCon T-shirts.

We donated a PyLadiesCon T-shirt to the PyLadies Auction (the item was won by [Catherine Devlin](https://github.com/catherinedevlin).
We're also thrilled to see Guido van Rossum wearing our T-shirt during the conference!

Georgi Ker gave a lightning talk about PyLadiesCon on the main stage, as well as during
the PyLadies Luncheon. We hope that this will help raise awareness about our conference, and encourage
more people to attend, support, and speak at PyLadiesCon.

engaging with the community online, and sharing social media updates throughout the conference using photos
that were shared by our team members onsite.
