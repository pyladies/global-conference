We're thrilled to announce that PyLadiesCon is participating in [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2025! 🎉

✨ [PyLadiesCon](https://conference.pyladies.com) is an online conference for the global PyLadies community.
Started in 2023, PyLadiesCon hosts 24 hours of online engagement, talks, keynotes, panels, and workshops for our
community members. We strive of inclusivity and accessibility, providing talks in multiple-languages,
and we take extra care in subtitling and translating our talks.

This year, we're developing our very own conference web portal, an open source solution for managing the organizational
aspect of our conference. The [Portal](https://portal.pyladies.com) is built with Python and Django,
and is designed to reduce the administrative burden and streamline the process of organizing our conference. We believe
that by building this portal, not only we will be able to manage our conference more efficiently, but we will also be
providing open source contribution opportunities from our community members, and therefore furthering the [PyLadies](https://pyladies.com)
mission of helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community.

This is the first year that our team is participating in GSoC. We have been participating under the Python GSoC umbrella,
and we are excited to welcome our first GSoC student, [Lucille Idokogi](https://github.com/lidokogi) who will be working
on developing the Sponsorship Portal for PyLadiesCon. Using the Sponsorship portal, we will be able to manage
and track our sponsorships, as well as automating the process of sponsorship outreach, invoicing, and reporting. All of
this will improve our efficiency when it comes to sponsorship and fundraising.

Here's what [Lucille](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucille-idokogi-216774304/) has to say about her project:

> Hey everyone! I’m Lucille Idokogi, a Computer Science and Data Science Undergraduate Student at Western University in Canada.
This summer, I’m super excited to be contributing to PyLadiesCon through Google Summer of Code. I’ve always been passionate about diversity and inclusion in tech, so getting to support a project that uplifts underrepresented voices really means a lot to me.
> I’m looking forward to growing as a developer, learning more about open source, and building something meaningful alongside this awesome community.
> Looking forward to a great summer! :)

Congratulations Lucille! We are excited to have you on board, and we look forward to seeing the impact of your work on our community.

Lucille will be working closely with our team, and mentored by [Mariatta](https://mariatta.ca) and [Cristián Maureira-Fredes](https://maureira.xyz/).

Thank you to the [Python GSoC](https://python-gsoc.org/) team for accepting our project and for their support throughout the process.
