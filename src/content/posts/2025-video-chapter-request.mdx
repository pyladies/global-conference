Hello PyLadies Community\!

We’re thrilled to invite all **PyLadies chapters around the world** to take part in something special for the **third edition of PyLadiesCon**, happening **December 5–7, 2025**\! 🌎✨

Each year, we showcase short videos from our chapters to highlight the incredible work happening across our global community — and we want **your chapter** to be part of it\!

## **💡 What’s this about?**

We’d love a **90-second (1 minute 30 seconds)** video introducing your PyLadies chapter — a friendly way to say “hi” to the global audience and share a glimpse of your journey, your community spirit, and your impact.

Your video will be featured during PyLadiesCon and celebrated across our social channels — it’s a great opportunity to show the world how your chapter empowers women and allies in Python and open source\! 🐍💪

## **🎥 What to include in your video**

Here are some ideas to guide you:

* **Chapter Introduction:** Tell us your chapter name, city, and country 🌍

* **Organizers:** Introduce your amazing organizers (names \+ roles) 💬

* **Your Story:** What inspired your chapter? What’s your mission? ❤️

* **Community Highlights:** Mention a few events, projects, or accomplishments you’re proud of 🎉

* **How to Connect:** Share your social media links or website so others can find you 🔗

✨ *Pro tip:* Prepare a short script before recording — it helps keep your message clear and confident.

If you’d like, you can use our [**PyLadiesCon slides template**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AfuoxJEMRfVJ648Il5BuDNMGHrKhvreSOfsMRtRqWGM/edit?usp=sharing) for your visuals, or simply add the [**PyLadiesCon logo**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YdH-okAxsURfe3oe1fDI7TrePn8BPsIb?usp=sharing) to your existing materials.

You can check [**video examples**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFvIcVqR5Dw&list=PLKiJs5wJSOOeWryfK7l5woXBF2suGey49) from the previous year.

## **🔁 Already submitted a video before?**

That’s awesome\! 🎉  
 If your chapter shared a video in a **previous edition**, please let us know if you’d like us to **reuse it** or if you prefer to **submit an updated version** this year.
