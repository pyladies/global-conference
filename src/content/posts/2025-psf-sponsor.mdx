The [Python Software Foundation](http://python.org/psf) (PSF) is proud to support PyLadiesCon 2025 through our Grants Program. We truly admire the dedication and passion of the organizers, speakers, and volunteers to put on this virtual conference with a mission to empower, educate, and foster diversity within the Python community\! PyLadies, the organization behind PyLadiesCon, is a [Fiscal Sponsoree of the PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/). This means the PSF provides 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status to Pyladies and manages back office work like cash flow, accounting, budgeting, insurance, and contract/legal support, as well as access to nonprofit discounts.

The PSF is the charitable organization behind Python, dedicated to advancing, supporting, and protecting the Python programming language and the diverse community that sustains it. That mission and cause are more than just words we believe in. Our [tiny but mighty team](https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/) works hard to deliver the projects and services that allow Python to be the thriving, independent, community-driven language it is today. 

Some of what the PSF does includes producing [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org), hosting the [Python Package Index](http://pypi.org) (PyPI), [supporting](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/) [5 Developers-in-Residence](https://www.python.org/psf/developersinresidence/)[,](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/) [maintaining critical community infrastructure](https://www.python.org/psf/about/), and much more\!

Both PyLadies and the PSF need our community's support to keep our work going, our community thriving, and the Python programming language growing and evolving. The PSF welcomes you to join our Python is for Everyone 2025 end-of-year fundraiser and membership drive campaign by visiting [donate.python.org](http://donate.python.org) to contribute and become a PSF Supporting Member. We also encourage you to donate directly to PyLadies through the [PyLadies donation page](https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&id=6). Lastly, if your employer uses Python, we encourage you to check if they are a [sponsor of the PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/). If not, reach out to your organization's internal decision-makers and impress on them just how important it is for us to power the future of Python together, and send them our [sponsor prospectus](https://s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pythondotorg-assets/media/files/psf_sponsor_prospectus_25-26_final_compressed.pdf). 

Python is for everyone– thanks to you\!
