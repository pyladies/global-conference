Just like last year, PyLadies Con 2024 will be a multiple-lingual online conference, happening at 6th-8th December 2024.


We are happy to announce that the CfP (call for proposal) of PyLadiesCon is [now live](https://pretalx.com/pyladiescon-2024/cfp)! You
have around 1 month time before the CfP closes at **September 15, 2024 (Anywhere on Earth.)** So if you have any good ideas, great ideas, or awesome ideas, please start writing a proposal, we would like to hear from you.

Here are some ideas what you can talk about:

- The Python programming language
- Useful Python libraries
- Web development
- Databases
- AI / ML
- Education
- The Python community
- Community management
- Leadership skills

…or anything you think other PyLadies would be interested to know.

Please remember, you **DO NOT** have to be an expert to share your experience or stories with us. You can share what you learn, what challenge you have overcome, or any good use-case of any Python libraries or open source technology that you know.

For more details about how to write a CfP, you can see Cheuk’s blog post, in [English](https://cheuk.dev/2023/06/06/how-to-be-speaker/) and [Spanish](https://cheuk.dev/2023/06/10/how-to-be-speaker-es/).

This year we accept talks in multiple languages:

**English, Español, Português, Deutsch, 日本語 and 中文**

so you can present in a language that you are most comfortable with.

Thank you for the translation and community engagement support from the following PyLadies chapters:

- PyLadies Tokyo
- PyLadies Berlin
- PyLadies Taiwan
- PyLadies Maputo
- PyLadies Colombia
- PyLadies Santo Domingo
- PyLadies São Carlos
