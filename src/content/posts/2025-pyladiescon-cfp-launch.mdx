### Why Speak at PyLadiesCon?
PyLadiesCon is a conference organized by PyLadies, for PyLadies and friends, with a mission to amplify the voices of women and gender minorities in Python globally.
Speaking at PyLadiesCon is not just about sharing your knowledge; it is about inspiring others, building your confidence, and helping our community grow together. Your perspective matters whether you’re a first-time speaker or experienced.

### What We’re Looking For
We welcome proposals on any topic of interest to the PyLadies community (introductory to advanced), including but not limited to:
- Python programming
- Data science and machine learning
- Web development
- Automation and tooling
- Open source and community building
- Career journeys and mentorship
- Accessibility and ethics in tech
- Non-code contributions in Python
- Your personal Python journey


We especially encourage first-time speakers and PyLadies from underrepresented regions to submit!
If you need inspiration, check out last year’s talks, or sign up for our “Craft a conference proposal” workshop [here](https://lu.ma/nkkeq1lz).

### How to Submit
Visit our [CFP Portal](https://pretalx.com/pyladiescon-2025/cfp) to submit your proposal. 
You can propose Talks (15 minutes max) or Panels (30 - 40 minutes)

Talks will be pre-recorded and live-streamed. As a speaker, you will be expected to submit your recorded talk a month before the conference (TBC). On the other hand, panels will be held live during the conference. You’re welcome to give your presentation in any language you choose. Don’t worry if it’s not in English, we will translate all non-English talks into English. In our previous events, we have received talks in [Spanish](https://pretalx.com/pyladiescon-2024/talk/CTPKVD/), [Portuguese](https://pretalx.com/pyladiescon-2024/talk/K9738A/), [Japanese](https://pretalx.com/pyladiescon-2024/talk/SAHJRU/) etc.

If you are new to public speaking and would need some help getting started with how to craft your proposal, sign up for this [upcoming workshop](https://lu.ma/nkkeq1lz), where we will provide tips, share examples and much more!

### Let’s Build PyLadiesCon 2025 Together!
Your voice matters, and your story could be exactly what someone else in our community needs to hear.
Submit your proposal, share with your local PyLadies chapter, and let’s make PyLadiesCon 2025 another beautiful gathering of learning, connection, and growth.

Submit your proposal today: [CFP Portal](https://pretalx.com/pyladiescon-2025/cfp)
We can’t wait to see what you’ll share!
