At Meta, Python is an essential tool used by tens of thousands of our engineers and developers every day.  It’s how we build large production codebases, like Instagram, and advanced AI/machine learning models..  
   
We know that Python would not be as successful as it is without the sustained, high quality contributions of the open source community surrounding it. This global network of developers, enthusiasts, and organizations consistently delivers high-quality code, documentation, and support, which are essential components for a modern programming language to survive.  
   
That's why events like PyLadiesCon are so vital, they ensure this vibrant community continues to thrive by providing learning opportunities for current and future Pythonistas, and by creating a space for new connections and collaborations to form. We are incredibly proud to support initiatives like this, because investing in you is investing in the future of Python.  
   
As an organization we are also actively contributing back to the Python ecosystem where we can, with a range of exciting open source initiatives currently in the works\! One initiative we’d like to highlight is that we've been working with the open source community to bring [free-threading](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/free-threading-python.html) to CPython, making the Global Interpreter Lock optional and enabling true multithreading for the first time. We're also building [Pyrefly](https://pyrefly.org/), a blazingly fast typechecker and IDE extension for Python that can infer types and automatically add annotations.  
   
We’ll be talking more about these projects in our talk during the conference, so come along if you’d like to learn more.  You can also find out more about Meta Open Source, by visiting our [website](https://opensource.fb.com/), subscribing to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCQY962PmHabTjaHv2wJzfQ), or following us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MetaOpenSource), [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@metaopensource), [X](https://x.com/MetaOpenSource), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/metaopensource.bsky.social) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/meta-open-source?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR2fEOJNb7zOi8rJeRvQry5sRxARpdL3OpS4sYLdC1_npkEy60gBS1ynXwQ_aem_mJUK6jEUApFTW75Emhtpqw).  
   
Thank you for being a part of this fantastic event, we hope you enjoy the activities, learn a lot, and connect with other Pythonistas. Let's keep building awesome things together\!
