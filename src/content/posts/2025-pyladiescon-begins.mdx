We're excited to welcome you at PyLadiesCon 2025 and kick-off all of our keynotes, talks, panels, and workshops.
Get ready for a weekend of engaging sessions at PyLadiesCon 2025!

Here are a few important details on how to join and participate.

### Register for the conference

First of all, please [register](https://pretix.eu/pyladiescon/2025/) for the conference to get access to all the sessions.

### Our conference schedule

Check the full [conference schedule](https://2025.conference.pyladies.com/en/schedule/) to find out when the talks, keynotes, panels, and workshops will be happening.
Note that the default timezone is in UTC, and you can switch the timezone to your local timezone.

### How to watch the talks

Our sessions are streamed as [a playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOItnwPQ-eHxvEOnu1MsRX_qkX7dyXAZS&si=DmREHdbdMuMZ4lMx) on YouTube.

While you can watch the talks directly on YouTube, we ask that you also register for the conference so it helps us
understand our audience better.

Each of our pre-recorded videos and talks have been transcribed by our volunteers, and you can access the transcription
by clicking the "CC" button on the video, or by clicking the "Show Transcript" button on each video's description.

Although most of our talks are in English, we do have several presentations in other languages, like in Spanish, Portuguese, French, Chinese, and Japanese.
For these talks, transcript in their original language are available, and additionally our volunteers have translated them into English.
You can access the English transcript translation by clicking the "Settings" (Gear) icon on YouTube > CC/Subtitles > English.

For sessions that are conducted live (like the keynotes, and panel discussions), the automatic captioning is available from YouTube as well.

### Join us on Discord

This is our main communication channel where you will be able to engage with other attendees.
After [registering](https://pretix.eu/pyladiescon/2025/) to the conference, you will have full access to Discord. Please read [this page](https://2025.conference.pyladies.com/en/attending/) for details on how to join.

Use the Discord ``#main-stream`` channel to chat and discuss the talks with other audiences. Many of our speakers will be around to answer questions about their talk asynchronously.

### Participating in Workshops

Our interactive workshops are hosted on Discord on the ``#activities-open-spaces`` and ``#activities-open-spaces` channels. Simply show up and join the channel to participate! Note that workshops are not recorded.

### Ask Python Core Devs

We are honored to have a few Python core developers participating in our conference and they be happy to answer any questions you have, from their career path, open source contribution experience, to their favorite ice cream flavor. Join them in the ``#ask-core-devs`` channel.

### Sprint

Contribute to open source during the sprints. Our sprint and project leaders will be able to help you pick an issue,
set up your development environment, and show you the contribution workflow.
You may also be encouraged to pair up with someone to contribute together.

The sprint starts on Sunday after the conference closing.

Check the [Sprints](https://2025.conference.pyladies.com/en/sprints/) page for more details.

### Open Space

An Open Space is a dynamic, self-organized session where attendees come together to discuss topics, collaborate on projects, learn new skills, or just networking in a welcoming and inclusive environment.
