Hello amazing PyLadies!

We have an exciting opportunity for your PyLadies Chapter to shine at the upcoming PyLadiesCon! We
invite you to create and share a 90-second video (1 minute 30 sec) introducing your wonderful
community. Hereâ€™s a guide to help craft your video:

**Participants**: One member from your community can present.

**Introduction**: Please introduce the organizers with their names and roles in the community.

**Scripting**: Consider preparing a script to succinctly convey the essence of your chapterâ€™s story
and activities.

**Presentation Material**: Feel free to use our specially designed PyLadiesCon template for your
video [Slides

If you have pre-existing materials, simply add the PyLadiesCon event logo.

**Submission**: Submit your recorded video in advance; it will be showcased during the event.

* A brief introduction of your chapter and its mission.
