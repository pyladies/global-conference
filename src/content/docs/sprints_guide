# Sprints guide for PyLadies Conference 2025

##As conference assistant:

**What is a Sprint?**
Sprint are informal coding sessions, and knoweldge sharing where people gather together to work on Open-Source projects, 
suggest changes in existing libraries solve problems.
A Sprint is an opportunity for learning and self-development while contributing to Open Source projects.

**How will the sprint work at PyladiesCon?**
During the conference, we will conduct mentored Sprint sessions where projects will be presented. 
You can then join the specific Discord channel to coordinate, work on, or ask questions about particular issues.

**What do I need to do to assist in the Sprint?**
First, secure your conference ticket, and then attend the mentored Sprint session. 
If your timezone prevents participation synchronously, you can still check out the proposed projects and join the Discord channel.

**When and Where?**
The Sprint will take place after the talks and panels: 
TBD: Sunday 7th of December
TBD: Add time to timezones

**Where can I find the projects in advance?**
TBD: link to website

##As Sprint Organizer:

**Open-Source Projects**
Anyone can submit a project for the sprints, although sprints are typically submitted by project maintainers or frequent contributors.

To submit a project for the sprints here:

https://github.com/pyladies/global-conference-2025/blob/main/src/pages/en/sprints.astro

And modify this section with your information:

const sprintsData = [
//{
//    name: "Project 1",
//    project_url: "https://github.com/myossp/project2",
//    project_doc_url: "https://docs.myossproject.com",
//    description: "This is an example project that will help you contribute to an OSS initiative!",
//    level: "Beginner friendly, Some math knowledge",
//    languages: "Python, Rust",
//  },
];

**What worked very well in the past?**
Create issue that could be "first time contribution friendly" and assign assign tags to your issues.


**First time runing a Sprint?**
1. Set clear objectives and desired outcomes for the Sprint.
2. Gather all essential materials.
3. Create issues of varying levels (beginner, documentation, etc.) on GitHub to make participation accessible.
