## PyLadiesCon Video Caption Verification Guide(2025)

💖 Welcome & Thank You
Thank you for volunteering your time and attention to support PyLadiesCon 2025!
Your effort ensures that our talks are accessible and inclusive for everyone across different languages, accents, and listening needs.
We’re so glad you’re part of this global community of detail-oriented heroes. 💪✨

### 🪄 Step 1: Connect on Discord

All communication happens on our Discord server.
1. Join the server if you haven’t done it yet: https://discord.gg/9DkA5fe3. 
2. Introduce yourself in the #welcome-volunteers channel.
3. Make sure you are connected on the #comms-for-video-caption-analysts channel -  that’s where you’ll find help and updates.

💡 Tip: Update your Discord display name to include your first name or role (e.g., “Aisha – Captions”) so the team can find you easily.


### 📂 Step 2: Access the 2025 PyLadiesCon Folders

Make sure you have access to the [**2025 PyLadiesCon Speakers Folders and Assets**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e9SxzK9h_LQyUso8SEHh0SUkBpHOQKoQkQjZ_vgukyE/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Drive.
Then open the sheet titled “Captioning/Translation Management” in that Google Sheet.
Search for the talks assigned to you. You’ll find details such as the talk title, speaker name, and raw video URL, talk captions link, MC captions link etc.

#### 🧾 How to Read the Sheet

Each row in the **“Captioning/Translation Management”** sheet represents one talk.  
Here’s what each column means:

| **Column** | **Name** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **A** | **Type** | Indicates the session type (e.g., *Regular*, *Keynote*, *Panel*). |
| **B** | **Main Stream** | The full title of the talk. |
| **C** | **Speaker/s** | Name(s) of the speaker(s) for that session. |
| **D** | **Lang** | The language used in the talk (e.g., *EN* for English). |
| **E** | **Raw Video Ready** | Checkbox indicating that the speaker’s pre-recorded video has been uploaded and is ready for captioning. |
| **F** | **MC Captioning** | Checkbox showing whether the MC’s intro/outro captions are ready for review. |
| **G** | **Talk Captions Checked** | Mark this box after you’ve verified and corrected the captions for the speaker’s talk. |
| **H** | **MC Captions Checked** | Mark this box once you’ve reviewed and confirmed the captions for the MC’s intro/outro video. |
| **I** | **Captioning Analyst In-Charge** | Your name (or another volunteer’s) — identifies who is responsible for reviewing captions for that specific talk. |
| **J** | **Raw Video URL** | Contains links to the Google Drive folder or files for the raw video files. |
| **K** | **Talk Captions Link** | Contains links to the Google Drive folder or files for the talk caption files (`.srt` or `.txt`). |
| **L** | **Talk Captions Link** | Contains links to the Google Drive folder or files for the MC caption files (`.srt` or `.txt`). |
| **M** | **Notes** | Add any comments here if there is anything noteworthy to inform the team. |

#### What You’ll Do Here

1. Search for your assigned talks by **speaker name** or **talk title**.  
2. Open the **raw video** and its **caption file** (`.srt` or `.txt`).  
3. Compare and correct the captions as needed.  
4. Save your verified file in the same folder with the proper naming format.  
5. Tick the relevant **“Talk Captions Checked”** or **“MC Captions Checked”** box to mark completion. ✅

 

### 🔍 Step 3: Review the Captions

Open the **raw video** (watch it on Drive or download if needed).
Open the corresponding **caption file** (.srt or .txt) in a text editor — e.g., Notepad, VS Code, or TextEdit.

#### What to Check:
- **Accuracy**: Does the caption text match what’s spoken?
- **Spelling & Grammar**: Fix typos, missing punctuation, or capitalization.
- **Names & Terms**: Verify speaker names, Python packages, technical terms, and brand names.
- **Flow**: Make sure lines break naturally and are easy to read.
- **Remove AI glitches**: e.g., random symbols, duplicate lines, or filler text.

*⚠️ Note: You can ignore timestamps — YouTube will automatically sync the text to audio when we upload the final captions.*

### 💾 Step 4: Save & Upload

When you’re done:
1. Save your corrected captions as a .txt file.
2. Use this naming format:
- For speaker talks:
```
speakersname-yourname-checked.txt
```
Example: reginaking-aisha-checked.txt
- For MC videos:
```
speakersname-mc-yourname-checked.txt
```
