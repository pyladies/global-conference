## PyLadiesCon Pre-Recorded MC Video Guide(2025)

💖 Welcome & Thank You
Thank you for volunteering your time to support PyLadiesCon!
Your efforts help us bring together voices, ideas, and inspiration from all around the world.
We’re so glad you’re part of this community, let’s make your video shine 🌟!

### 🪄 Step 1: Connect on Discord

All communication happens on our Discord server.
1. Join the server if you haven’t done it yet: https://discord.gg/9DkA5fe3. 
2. Introduce yourself in the #welcome-volunteers channel.
3. Make sure you are connected on the #comms-for-mcs-and-moderators 🎙️ channel -  that’s where you’ll find help and updates.


*💡 Tip: Update your Discord display name to include your first name or role (e.g., “Aisha – MC”) so the team can find you easily.*


### 📂 Step 2: Access the 2025 PyLadiesCon Folders

Make sure you can access the [**2025 PyLadiesCon Speakers Folders and Assets**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e9SxzK9h_LQyUso8SEHh0SUkBpHOQKoQkQjZ_vgukyE/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Drive.
Then open the sheet titled “MC Recording Management” in that Google Sheet.
Search for the talks assigned to you. You’ll find details such as the talk title, speaker name, and file folder,etc
 

### 📝 Step 3: Prep Work Before Recording

Before you start recording, have a quick run-through of the talk you’ll be introducing.
List down:
- The **talk title**
- The **speaker’s name**
- Their **pronouns**
- Review the **talk link** to get familiar with the topic
- (Optional) If time allows, check the speaker’s background or if the topic matches your expertise, share your excitement in a line or two!

We suggest preparing your **script or key points** before recording.

#### 🎛️ Tech Setup
- **Lighting**: Face a window or light source. Avoid backlighting.
- **Camera**: Use your laptop or webcam. If using a phone, record horizontally (landscape 16:9).
- **Sound**: Record in a quiet space. Use earbuds or a mic if available.
- **Background**: Keep it clean, simple, or show your local PyLadies spirit!
- **Mic check**: Do a short test — make sure your voice is clear.
- Save videos in **.mp4** format.


### 🎬 Step 4: Record the Intro

1. Do a short test clip to check your setup.
2. You can follow one of the **sample intros** below or improvise your own.
3. Start with a friendly greeting: say hi, your name, the talk you’re introducing, and the speaker’s name.
4. Add a sentence or two about the topic or the speaker.
5. Don’t stress if you stumble — just pause and keep going; editors will trim later.
6. End with a smile or a wave to keep it warm and welcoming.
Keep it short and upbeat — **under 1 minute.**
Imagine you’re talking to another PyLady halfway across the world! 💫

#### 📁 Save file as:
```
title-speakername-yourname-intro.mp4
```

Example:
```
How-to-be-a-champion-reginaking-intro.mp4
```

### 🎤 Step 5: Record the Outro

Using the same setup as the intro:
- Thank the speaker by name.
- If you’ve watched the talk, share a quick personal takeaway or reaction.
- Thank the audience and encourage them to stay tuned for the next session.
#### 📁 Save as:
```
title-speakername-yourname-outro.mp4
```

Example:
```
How-to-be-a-champion-reginaking-outro.mp4
```
 
### 📤 Step 6: Submit Your Recording

Once you’re happy with your videos:
- Upload them to the **same Google Drive folder** where you found the talk.
- Go back to the **MC Recording Management** sheet.
- Check the box in the **“MC Recording”** column to notify the team it’s complete.
