### Volunteers Coordinator

* **Call for Volunteers:**
The Volunteers Coordinator is responsible for managing the recruitment and
selection process of volunteers for the PyLadies Con conference. They should

review volunteer applications, ensuring a diverse and inclusive team of
volunteers.

* Team Logistics:
The Volunteers Coordinator oversees the organization and distribution of tasks
among the volunteer team. They should assess volunteers' skills, interests, and
availability and assign appropriate roles and responsibilities. The coordinator
should maintain clear communication channels to ensure volunteers are
well-informed about their assigned tasks, timelines, and specific instructions.
They should also provide necessary training or orientation to volunteers, if
required, to ensure they are equipped with the knowledge and resources to
fulfill their roles effectively.

assistance, and other operational requirements. They should be available as
a point of contact for volunteers during the event, addressing any questions,
issues, or emergencies.
