## Equipment Recommendation

We recommend several equipments to make you feel confident in your presentation:

### Webcam

A camera with a resolution of at least 1080p.

Examples:

- Smartphone / iPhone

- [Logitech C930](https://www.amazon.ca/Logitech-1080p-Video-Webcam-960-000971/dp/B00CRJWW2G/ref=sr_1_6?crid=348GC5IY6W5FR&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ulcMZFp-j_sZlPoxgLvTzfLg9hiFoJDKJ-PvU-YI_MYUQyQQqleb9sSQSRyTWi-hrr1_dZpTIjvNpsIafNJzCg3IkASbN8Asg5J6tsu712K9KCUnR3H175VTyGn5pvBzNAwkf9OIA35SXJphkdvRi-b9kOg6EQnmSgDE8ReDpQjCOhp6p3g5taPLgWOeAFdn2i2d7d4oWObNP71vncvNt4noupnl6laAZ3z_iC0G1bZr2AuFEMf9B2LnUSce63GCbb0z0Tuz08lAh8Lauh-ROvMSLeubH5Wyp5zCqwuPN4U.Vz8hMG1UvJBEwVjoFGn1q39a0peKJC7RH9tC9XIDYMg&dib_tag=se&keywords=logitech+930&qid=1731106599&sprefix=logitech+930%2Caps%2C204&sr=8-6)

### Microphone

**Do not use** the built-in microphone that comes with your laptop/webcam/phone.

The built-in audio quality is really poor, and it will affect the overall quality of your presentation.

Instead, please use one of the following options:

- An external USB microphone, or
- A headset with microphone, or
- A lavalier microphone

Examples:

- [Boya lavalier mic](https://www.amazon.ca/BOYA-Professional-Microphone-Omnidirectional-Smartphone/dp/B09QKYWPMD/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.88zqf6Bwx5Gk8i-vi4S-V4q9e-QGyCXH7NBkq9s49MQQrRsIqzZIa671wm2wvi3LK-yL648GZ4gXmQRobpNtrf6ZOyZCwCJnTc0-ttuRA2Z2ep5kEW4i9p5y4C0GyYWD1MSn8LUWThc0YOvtmgAoilSU6kKZwYoHJ844Peklxqu48bIec4NByGHmxMsAQ2qivGOYvORcrdUdjTmfYvrW9dUrUQCeBbD6QQhlabrKq8Fav4PFVpOfGwFyfAl1VSQTL423FK3qfndyaNi4709vYsyCQfY7MzhxoTTMdO6eBU4.zY67nOZSHW2EkQGXdy29G_oi26d_kQYGoc3jwvsUQ1c&dib_tag=se&hvadid=604602790312&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1001941&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=13731630213879322326&hvtargid=kwd-303673828468&hydadcr=872_1015038289&keywords=boya+lavalier+microphone&qid=1731106351&sr=8-3-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1)

- [Razer Kraken Gaming Headset](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kraken-Gaming-Headset-2019/dp/B07QNZC9V5/?th=1) 

### Ring light or light panel

- Proper lightning can improve video quality

### Instructions on how to use your Smartphone for video recording/streaming

If you have smartphones (from within the last 3-4 years), it would likely have a really good camera for recording/streaming videos.
If you do not have a good webcam, we highly recommend this option.

#### Android phone with PC

- Use the DroidCam app: you’ll need to install the app on your phone and on your PC

## Talk Tips and Tricks

If you're new to video presentation, here are a few tips below.

### How to give a successful talk

Here are some tips to help you to deliver a successful talk.

#### Slides

Avoid putting too much text on a slide, try to use point forms, diagrams, or pictures. Consider that your audience
may be watching on a small screen or even a phone.

#### Opening slide

This slide should include your presentation title and speaker's names. This is one of the 2 slides that you can
include your company logo if you want to.

#### Learning Objectives Outline

If you’re explaining a new tool or a how-to, it is always nice to provide a slide stating clear and actionable
learning objectives. Learning objectives are statements that provide a context for what will be shared during the presentation.

What you are saying is the key and the slide is only there to supplement what you are talking about.

#### Social media handles

Adding your social media handles helps people who are inspired by your talk reach out to you if they have more
questions regarding your talk.

#### Accessibility

Also, check out the accessibility session below to make the slides more accessible to audiences. 

#### Self introduction

Many speakers prefer to have one slide to introduce themselves, you can use this opportunity to explain why
you are the best person to give this talk, or make yourself relatable to the audience.

#### Telling a story

Giving a talk is like telling a story, try to think of what is your “story” that you are going to tell? Usually a
story will have a beginning, middle and the end. The beginning can be, for example, I have a problem that I want to
solve, or this is how I discover this library. The middle can be the technical part that you want to explain something,
for example, how to solve the problem, how you learn something, what library to use etc. For the end, it could be a
summary of the points that you made in your talk, and/or it could be a call for an action item.

#### Unbiased and Non-Promotional Content

Presentation content must be unbiased and not disparage, promote, or market any individual's or company's products or
services. Program materials may not include any proprietary information, must be educational and generic in nature,
and must reinforce the learning objectives.

Please keep in mind that we do not encourage you to include your company logo or name on all slides of the template
except on the first and the last slide of the presentation.

#### Rehearse your talk

Some speakers prefer to rehearse their talk so they know if the timing for the talk is right. You can either practice
by yourself or find a friend to help. If you would like help from any of the PyLadiesCon volunteers, please do not
hesitate and let us know, and we will get you set up. We’re here to make you feel confident about your talk.

We do find new and first-time speakers would benefit from rehearsal. Other speakers may rehearse but not too much,
so the talk can be more organic. This all depends on the talk and your own presentation style.

#### Speaker Notes / Script

Giving a presentation can be nerve-wracking, and you might feel worried about forgetting your speech. You can write
speaker notes or talk scripts to help you feel more confident about giving your presentation. Some speakers use a
talk script, some people don’t. This is totally optional, and you can decide whether this will be useful to you.

#### Recording Demo

If you would like to record a demo for your talk, there are free screen capture software available: if you are using
macOS you can use Quicktime Player (comes with your macOS by default), if your demo is less than 5 mins,
[loom.com](https://www.loom.com/) is free to use if your recording is under 5 mins.

#### Remember to remain hydrated

No matter the length of your talk, it is smart to keep a glass of water with you during your talk. So if you need a
few seconds to take a break, or just to gather some thoughts, or something got stuck in the throat, a glass of water
is your best friend.

## Making it accessible

Here are a few points that can help to make your talk more accessible

- Slides would be high contrast and have large enough font size. Light background and dark text work the best.
- You can check on the contrast using this link: [https://colourcontrast.cc/](https://colourcontrast.cc/) or other
- similar sites that help you with color contrast check.

- Use [accessible fonts](https://www.accessibility.com/blog/what-are-accessible-fonts) if possible

- Extra information about accessible designs: [https://accessibility.uncg.edu/getting-started-with-accessibility/accessible-design/](https://accessibility.uncg.edu/getting-started-with-accessibility/accessible-design/)

- No flashing animation

- Not all attendees are native English (or any other language) speakers, so try to speak clearly and slowly

- If there are images or videos on your slides, add the description to it, and mention it as you present the image.
- This way, those who are blind can read the description, and those who are deaf can hear the description from you.

Consider using good contrasting colors so that they are friendly for people with visual disabilities.
