# Open Space guide for PyLadies Conference 2025

## What's an Open Space?

An Open Space is a dynamic, self-organized session where attendees come together to discuss topics, collaborate on projects, learn new
skills, or just networking in a welcoming and inclusive environment.

## Who can join or lead an Open Space?

If you're planning to attend PyLadiesCon 2025, you're welcome to participate in or facilitate an Open Space session! This is
your chance to share knoweldge, ask questions, or discuss about topics that intrigues you with fellow conference attendees.

## How to organize an Open Space?

To help us manage the logistics of the Open Spaces better, we kindly ask you to fill out a form if you're planning on leading one during
the conference. We won't be approving or rejecting any Open Spaces as long as they align with our Code of Conduct.

[TBD: Add a form]

## Where will the Open Spaces take place?

We'll set up dedicated voice (and optional video) channels in our Discord server for the Open Spaces. This way, everyone can easily join
and participate from anywhere they're comfortable.

## Need assistance with running an Open Space?

Our organizer team is more than happy to help answer any questions you might have about Open Space. 
Send us an email at **pyladiescon@pyladies.com** if you need guidance or have any concerns.
