The PyLadies Conference (PyLadiesCon) is an exciting online and free event
dedicated to empowerment, learning, and diversity within the Python community! ðŸŽ‰

The conference was born out of a need to gather all the PyLadies communities
around the world, on a global event in order to lower the barrier for
travelling to different places. We love in-person conferences! but we do know
it's impossible to get all the communities in one place, and even with
financial support, we will struggly to get members from far away places.

By enabling everyone to be in touch with the rest of the community we will
spark dicussions that can improve the global community, new local groups, fresh
ideas to handle our communication, etc.

This conference is designed to promote diversity, learning, and empowerment
within the Python community. We enthusiastically welcome presenters from
members and supporters of the PyLadies Community. Prior experience is optional
to share your insights and expertise. Given that we are a global community, we
warmly invite talks in the following languages: English, EspaÃ±ol, PortuguÃªs,
Deutsch, æ—¥æœ¬èªž and ä¸­æ–‡.
